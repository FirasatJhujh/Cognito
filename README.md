# Cognito
Cognito is a fun and interactive game that attempts to guess the word you're thinking of based on your answers to a series of clever and guided inputs. Built with an intuitive logic system
## Guide
Cognito guides the player through a series of character-matching stages:

 - Think of a word (any word of your choice).

 - Cognito will ask where specific characters of your word appear in dynamically generated columns or rows of letters.

 - You simply click or mark the correct positions where your word's characters appear.

 - After enough information is gathered, Cognito will predict the word you had in mind â€” with shocking accuracy!
